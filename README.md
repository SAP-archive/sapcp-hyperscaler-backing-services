# SAP Cloud Platform Hyperscaler Backing Services
This repository of assets supports the consumption of hyperscaler backing services from SAP Cloud Platform.

## Overview

Following the core principles of *openness* and *freedom of choice*, SAP Cloud Platform released an updated strategy that outlines how the platform will partner and enable integration with hyperscale providers intensively to procure commoditized technical services such as open source backing services.

SAP Cloud Platform is announced to be available on the following hyperscalers â€“ Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Alibaba Cloud (AliCloud).

As of today, the platform plans to support consumption of 'PostgreSQL' services from the above hyperscale providers. Support for Amazon RDS PostgreSQL and Azure Database for PostgreSQL has been released. Work on support for Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL is underway.

Through this repository, we intend to share assets like sample code, which can help customers/partners/stakeholders in consuming open source backing services from hyperscalers on SAP Cloud Platform. These assets will be grouped into folders based on the hyperscale provider like AWS, AZURE, GCP, and so on, with their respective README files.

## Requirements

The hyperscaler strategy for backing services has been built on the foundation of **BYOA - 'Bring Your Own Account'**. 

This means to consume open-source backing services from hyperscalers on SAP Cloud Platform, consumers will be expected to procure accounts/subscriptions directly from hyperscale providers in addition to procuring a SAP Cloud Platform account.

Administrator access to the hyper-scaler account - to create account configurations, keys, users would be mandatory.

## Download and Installation

The procedure to download and install each asset will be covered in the corresponding README file.

## Known Issues

Known issues for each asset will be covered in the corresponding README file.
